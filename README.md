## Overview
GoodEats is a fullstack app that allows users to create, edit, and favor recipes from all over the the world.
Users can see all the recipes that are made on the website and go to them in order to see what ingredients are needed and what steps are needed to make a delicious meal. 
Users can also make their own recipes and have them displayed for everyone else to see. Users can also favor other people's recipes and see them on their own profile page to be able to easily find them again in the future.
